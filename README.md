## Search With Tech
Check out our Devpost submission [here](https://devpost.com/software/search-with-tech)!
Ever spend countless days and weeks trying to search for a job and find yourself aimlessly scrolling through pages and pages of job listings? As co-op students at the University of Waterloo, we are expected to apply to hundreds of internship positions every term. During our first work search period, we realized that browsing through hundreds of job postings on tons of sites is far from efficient. Search With Tech is the solution we wish we had during our job search - a quick and efficient service that searches several sites at once to find the top hits with great precision.

## What it does
[Search With Tech](http://searchwith.tech) is a web application that facilitates the job search process, and allows you to search for jobs with our tech (which is basically our project). It does so by gathering all your options in a single place. Just input a job title and a preferred location, and Search with Tech will offer you a curated list to speed up the job hunt. Search With Tech scrapes job search titles, such as Indeed.com, Workpolis.com, and several others to provide users with the most extensive results. The listings are compiled into one convenient table so that job-seekers can scroll through in one go and pick out jobs that catch their eye.

## How we built it
The front-end of the web application was created using HTML/CSS, using styling inspiration from a Bootstrap template. The back-end was built using Python, BeautifulSoup and Requests libraries, as well as the framework Flask to unionize the front and back ends.

## Challenges we ran into
We had trouble integrating the front-end with the back-end of our build, because none of the team members are very comfortable with this process or with the Flask framework. For this reason, we were not able to help one another and provide suggestions and assistance to one another. Each of us had to spend time on your own to learn the tech stack and figure everything out before the deadline.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud that the project was completed on time, and that Search With Tech includes all of the functionality that we planned out prior to starting the build. We expertly divided the roles and managed our time to leave sufficient time for debugging, testing and formatting all submission materials. This is an important accomplishment because all team members were very conscious about their abilities, while also being realistic about deadlines and timeframes for the completion of the project. 

## What we learned
Throughout this build, we learned how to effectively collaborate in front-end/back-end integration, and also communicate about expectations about the final result. We had to learn to use Flask, and also deployed our first web application. Since we did not dedicate time to creating a very detailed and visually-appealing final result model, a lot of communication was required to effectively put all of the pieces of the project together. In the end, we were able to submit a final result that met all team membersâ€™ expectations.

## What's next for Search With Tech
In the near future, we plan to extend Search With Tech to all major job board sites, in order to encompass all job opportunities online into a single job search engine. As well, we are eager to also extend the functionality to university-specific job boards, such as WaterlooWorks (at the University of Waterloo) and CLNX (at the University of Toronto).
